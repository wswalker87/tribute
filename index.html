            <blockquote><p>"The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not what Islam is all about. 
                Islam is peace. These terrorists don't represent peace. They represent evil and war. 
                When we think of Islam we think of a faith that brings comfort to a billion people around the world. 
                Billions of people find comfort and solace and peace, and that's made brothers and 
                sisters out of every race, out of every race."</p><footer><cite>George W. Bush on 9/17/2001</cite></footer></blockquote>
